- 👋 Hi, I’m @gentiankasa
- 👀 I’m interested in a ton of things, programming being one of them... hiking, biking, martial arts, psycology, entrepreneurship being among the rest :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: rust, business analysis, project management, pençak silat, kali, survival techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects (I know that the definition of "interesting" is very vague, but if the project aims at helping someone, I may be interested to collaborate)
- 📫 How to reach me: [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gentiankasa/)
